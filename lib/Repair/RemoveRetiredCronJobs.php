/**
 * Removes the `oc_jobs` rows left behind when this app's background jobs moved
 * out of the retired `OCA\OpenCatalogi\Cron` namespace into
 * `OCA\OpenCatalogi\BackgroundJob` (ADR-100 Decision 3, PR #1119).
 *
 * THIS IS NOT PRECAUTIONARY — THE ORPHANS WERE MEASURED. On a live instance
 * carrying the merged move, `oc_jobs` still held
 *
 *   OCA\OpenCatalogi\Cron\DirectorySync
 *   OCA\OpenCatalogi\Cron\RetentionEvaluation
 *
 * next to their `BackgroundJob` replacements, naming classes that no longer
 * exist.
 *
 * WHY THE MOVE ALONE DOES NOT DO THIS. `appinfo/info.xml`'s `<job>` entries are
 * a REGISTRATION instruction, not a description of state. On upgrade Nextcloud
 * ADDS any job it does not already have; it never removes one whose class
 * disappeared, because it cannot tell a renamed class from one that is merely
 * unavailable this boot. So the rename leaves the instance holding both rows.
 *
 * The orphan is not inert. `\OC\BackgroundJob\JobList::buildJob()` cannot
 * instantiate a class that does not exist, so every cron tick that reaches the
 * row fails to build it, and that failure is logged rather than raised — the
 * quiet kind of broken, on an instance where the replacement job runs fine and
 * nothing looks wrong.
 *
 * Idempotent: `IJobList::remove()` on an absent class is a no-op, so a fresh
 * install passes through unchanged and re-running costs one DELETE matching
 * nothing.
